# BLOOD-BANK-Database-System
This project is part of the Database Systems course. The Blood Bank Management System was developed collaboratively to design and implement a database that improves blood resource management. We applied concepts like table design, data management, and SQL queries, aiming to enhance blood management processes in healthcare institutions.
