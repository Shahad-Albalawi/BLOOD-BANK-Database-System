## Database Systems Project

This project is part of the Database Systems course that we are studying. The Blood Bank Management System was developed in collaboration with my team, where we worked together to design and implement an effective database aimed at improving the management of blood resources.

Throughout this project, we applied the concepts of database systems, including table design, data management, and the use of SQL queries. We hope that this system will enhance blood management processes in healthcare institutions.
